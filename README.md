# 🌙 NERA AI

NERA AI is not just a project — it is a story of redemption.  
It was born from a mistake, a moment of weakness that opened my eyes to how dangerous technology can become when misused. That moment could have destroyed trust forever. Instead, it became the seed of a mission: to build AI that protects dignity, safeguards women, and restores respect where technology has caused harm.

## ✨ Why NERA AI?
In today’s world, AI can create deepfakes, steal faces, and ruin lives within seconds. Behind every fake image is a real person, a real family, and a shattered trust.  

NERA AI exists to stand against that.  
It is my way of saying *never again*.  
It is proof that even pain can turn into purpose, and even mistakes can give birth to missions greater than ourselves.

## 🚀 What NERA AI Is Today
- A **front-end prototype**, built in Lovable AI.  
- A vision brought into code with **React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn-ui**.  
- A simple user interface that represents something much bigger: a safe space where misuse of technology is not allowed to exist.  

This is not the final product — it is the first step of a long journey.

## 📖 The Road Ahead
NERA AI will grow into a real defense system against digital harm.  
The vision is clear:

- Stop the circulation of harmful content.  
- Build trust, respect, and dignity back into technology.

## 🙏 A Dedication
NERA AI is dedicated to every person who has ever been hurt by the misuse of technology.  
It is dedicated to those who forgave when forgiveness felt impossible.  
It is a promise that technology can serve humanity with ethics, compassion, and honor.  

This project is not about me. It is about turning a painful chapter into a message for the world:  
**Your mistakes do not define you — what you build from them does.**
